Added random weights. When weights < 0, error shoots off to infinity
Probably it jumps around so much because since there is only one set of data, there are so many ways to "solve" that
because you aren't trying to find a solution for a trend, but simply trying to find how much ways you can get a specific output from 2 specific numbers

For example, given 1 and 2, trying to get 3 we can have
    1 + 2 = 3
    5(1) - 2 = 3
    -5(1) + 4(2) = 3
